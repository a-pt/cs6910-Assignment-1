Gradient_Descent_Solution[1-7].iypnb

Question 1-7 is implemented in the single file Gradient_Descent_Solution[1-7].iypnb
The code implements backpropogation algorithm for feed forward neural network in with the following functionalities:
Optimizers:              Stochastic,NAG,Momentum,RMSPorp,Adam,Nadam
Activation Fucntions:    Sigmoid, Tanh, ReLu
Initialization:          Random, Xavier

Fucntions:
-prep_pixels(test_data,train_data) - Datapreprocessing [Normalization]
-
-initialize(string,no_of_input, no_of_hidden_layer, no_of_output,neurons_in_hidden_layer) - Initialize weights and biases with either one of the option(random or xavier) according to the first argument.
-
